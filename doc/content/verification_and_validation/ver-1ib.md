# A Species Equilibration Problem in Ratedep Condition with Unequal Starting Pressures

## General Case Description

<!-- All necessary equations -->
This verification problem is taken from [!cite](ambrosek2008verification) and builds on Equilibration Problem verified in [ver-1ia](ver-1ia.md). The configuration and modeling parameters are the same as in [ver-1ia](ver-1ia.md), except that, in the current case, there are unequal starting pressures for $A_2$ and $B_2$. The case is simulated in [/ver-1ib.i].

The problem considers the reaction between two isotopic species, $A_2$ and $B_2$, on a surface in ratedep condition. The reaction is described as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reaction}
\frac{1}{2} A_2 + \frac{1}{2} B_2 \rightleftharpoons AB,
\end{equation}

and the partial pressure of $A_2$, $B_2$, and $AB$ in equilibrium of the reaction is defined by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reaction_equilibrium_pressure}
\frac{P_{AB}}{\sqrt{P_{A_2}} \sqrt{P_{B_2}}} = K_{eq},
\end{equation}

where $P_i$ is the partial pressure of corresponding gas $i$, $K_{eq}$ is the equilibrium constant, and $K_{eq} = 2$ in this isotope reaction. Therefore, the partial pressure of $AB$ in equilibrium is a constant value depends on initial partial pressure of $A_2$ and $B_2$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p_AB_equilibrium}
P_{AB}^{eq} = \frac{2 P_{A_2}^0 P_{B_2}^0}{P_{A_2}^0 + P_{B_2}^0}.
\end{equation}

Under ratedep condition, the conversion rate at the surface is higher than the rate in enclosure. We solve

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equation_p_ab}
\frac{d P_{AB}}{dt} = \frac{S k T}{V} (2 K_r C_A C_B - K_d P_{AB}),
\end{equation}

where $t$ is the time, $S$ is the surface area, $k$ is the Boltzmannâ€™s constant, $T$ is the temperature, $V$ is the volume in the enclosure, $K_r$ and $K_d$ are the recombination and dissociation rate, $C_A$ and $C_B$ are the concentration of $A_2$ and $B_2$ on the reactive surface, respectively. If diffusion is small, the almost constant numbers of A and B atoms in the gas imply that $C_A$ and $C_B$ should have an almost constant value regardless of the isotopic species composition. The production of $C_A$ and $C_B$ in equilibration is given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:equal_c_a_c_b}
C_A C_B = \frac{K_d}{2 K_r} P_{AB}^{eq}.
\end{equation}

<!-- Detail parameters -->
This case uses starting pressures of $1e4$ Pa of $H_2$ and $1e5$ Pa of $D_2$ and no $HD$. $K_d$ was specified to be $1.858e24/\sqrt{T}$ atom/m$^2$/s/pa. $K_r$ was specified to be $5.88e-26$ m$^4$/atom/s. Temperature was 1000 K, the surface area for reaction was a 5 cm $\times$ 5 cm square, and the enclosure volume was 1 m$^3$.


## Analytical solution

<!-- introduce the analytical equation and explain -->
[!cite](ambrosek2008verification) provides the analytical equation for the partial pressure of $AB$ as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:analytical_solution}
P_{AB}  = \frac{2 P_{A_2}^0 P_{B_2}^0}{P_{A_2}^0 + P_{B_2}^0} (1 - exp(-\frac{S K_d k T}{V} t)).
\end{equation}

## Results

<!-- introduce the numerical result and compare the figures between analytical and results -->

A comparison of the concentration of $AB$ as a function of time is plotted in [ver-1ib_comparison_pressure]. The TMAP8 calculations are found to be in good agreement with the analytical solution, with root mean square percentage errors (RMSPE) of RMSPE =  1.32%. The concentration of $H_2$ and $D_2$ as a function of time are also plotted in [ver-1ib_comparison_pressure].
